# Python supports the following arithmetic operators:
# + for addition
# - for subtraction
# * for multiplication
# / for division (floating-point division)
# // for floor division (rounds down to the nearest integer)
# % for modulo (returns the remainder after division)
# ** for exponentiation (raises a number to a power)

# Examples of each operator:

# Addition
print(2 + 3) # 5

# Subtraction
print(5 - 2) # 3

# Multiplication
print(2 * 3) # 6

# Division
print(6 / 2) # 3.0

# Floor Division
print(6 // 2) # 3

# Modulo
print(7 % 3) # 1

# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3) # 8
